                    <h3>Lab 6 Journal Questions & Answers</h3>

                    <h4>1. Why is the frontend‚Äìbackend connection important?</h4>
                    <p>The frontend-backend connection is crucial because it enables persistent data storage beyond individual browser sessions, allows multiple users to access and share the same data, provides server-side validation and security, and enables more complex business logic that can't be handled client-side. It separates concerns between presentation (frontend) and data management (backend).</p>

                    <h4>2. Which HTTP methods did you use in Flask, and why?</h4>
                    <p>I implemented three main HTTP methods in Flask: GET for retrieving all reflections from the server, POST for adding new reflections with proper data validation, and DELETE as an extra feature for removing specific entries. These methods follow RESTful principles and provide complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</p>

                    <h4>3. What is the difference between using Flask to store and load JSON data and reading JSON directly in the browser?</h4>
                    <p>Flask stores data persistently on the server, making it accessible to all users and surviving browser sessions. Direct JSON reading is client-side only, limited to individual browsers, and doesn't provide real persistence. Flask also enables server-side processing, validation, and can scale to handle multiple concurrent users.</p>

                    <h4>4. Did you face any difficulties when running your project on PythonAnywhere? How did you handle them?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, I encountered path configuration issues where Flask couldn't find the templates and static folders. I resolved this by using absolute paths with <code>os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))</code>. Also, WSGI configuration required careful setup to properly import the Flask application instance.</p>

                    <h4>5. What extra feature did you build into your PWA with Flask, and why did you add it?</h4>
                    <p>I implemented DELETE functionality for individual reflections to provide complete content management. This allows users to remove entries they no longer want, making the application more practical and user-friendly. It demonstrates proper RESTful API design with multiple HTTP methods.</p>

                    <h3>Lab 5 Journal Questions & Answers</h3>

                    <h4>1. How is storing data in a JSON file different from using browser storage?</h4>
                    <p>JSON files are cross-platform and version-controlled. They are saved as physical files that may be accessed by multiple apps. Browser storage is device-specific, restricted to 5-10MB, and accessible only through JavaScript within the same browser.</p>

                    <h4>2. How did you use Python to create or update your JSON file?</h4>
                    <p>Created save_entry.py, which intelligently handles the JSON file by creating it if it is lacking, reading existing entries, adding new ones with automated timestamps, and safely writing everything back with proper formatting and error handling for reliability.</p>

                    <h4>3. What does your PWA show locally, and what will users see on GitHub? Are they the same? Why or why not?</h4>
                    <p>Local development displays live JSON updates when Python adds entries. GitHub Pages pauses JSON at commit time since it simply serves static files and does not do any backend processing. They remain synchronised by manual commits.</p>

                    <h4>4. What extra feature did you add to your PWA using the JSON file, and why?</h4>
                    <p>Added an interactive statistics dashboard that counts and categorises data based on their source (JSON/Local/Static). This clearly shows the Python-JS data flow and provides immediate feedback when new entries are added, improving both functionality and learning experience.</p>

                    <h3>Which Storage, Browser, and Third-Party APIs did you choose, and why?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Storage API:</strong> Enhanced local storage for journal entries and theme choices, including Session Storage as a backup option. It was chosen for its simplicity and widespread browser support.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browser API:</strong> Clipboard API for copying journal entries and improved Validation API for form validation. These considerably improve the overall user experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Third-Party API:</strong> The YouTube Player API allows you to connect with educational videos. We choose video content since it improves the learning experience.</p>

                    <h3>How did you integrate each API with DOM manipulation?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Storage API:</strong> localStorage.setItem() saves data and then dynamically builds DOM elements on load.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clipboard API:</strong> Added copy buttons to journal entries that use navigator.clipboard.writeText() and provide visual feedback.</p>
                    <p><strong>YouTube API:</strong> YT.Player() generates embedded video, custom buttons manage player using API functions.</p>

                    <h3>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Clipboard API permissions:</strong> Some browsers require a secure context (HTTPS). Error handling and backup messages were included.</p>
                    <p><strong>YouTube API loading:</strong> The API script needed to load before being initialised. I used the onYouTubeIframeAPIReady callback.</p>
                    <p><strong>Overlapping buttons:</strong> Stop button moved off-screen; corrected with CSS Grid and responsive layouts.</p>

                    <h3>In what ways do these APIs improve your Learning Journal PWA?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Persistence:</strong> When the browser is closed, users' entries and preferences are saved.</p>
                    <p><strong>Usability:</strong> One-click copying and quick form response.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rich Content:</strong> Video integration improves learning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Professional appearance:</strong> Native app experience with smooth interactions.</p>

                    <h3>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why did you choose them?</h3>
                    <p>I used getElementById() for single items such as the live date and theme toggle because it is quick and precise. Due to its flexibility and ability to take CSS selectors, I also utilised querySelectorAll() for many items, such as collapsable sections.</p>

                    <h3>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</h3>
                    <p>The most difficult aspect was ensuring that the JavaScript loaded at the appropriate time and that all DOM elements were available when the scripts attempted to access them. This timing issue was resolved by using the DOMContentLoaded event.</p>

                    <h3>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</h3>
                    <p>I used browser developer tools extensively, including console.log for debugging data, the Elements tab for checking DOM structure, and for myself testing all interactive features on various screen sizes to verify responsiveness.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile-First Design Approach</h3>
                    <p>I began by designing with mobile devices in mind, utilising a layout with one column that eventually expands on larger screens. This method ensured that the essential content and functionality worked flawlessly on reduced viewports.</p>

                    <h3>Most Useful HTML/CSS Concept</h3>
                    <p>The CSS Flexbox concept was the most helpful one I used to create responsive layout structures and navigation. With Flexbox, creating flexible components that adjust to various screen sizes without requiring intricate computations was simple.</p>

                    <h3>Most Challenging Aspect</h3>
                    <p>The hardest things for me were choosing a breakpoint and media queries. To enable smooth transitions between layouts, the ideal breakpoints for various devices needed to be tested and adjusted.</p>
